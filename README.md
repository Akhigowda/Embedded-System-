Automatic Medicine Dispenser 

As part of my Microprocessor and Computer Architecture course, we designed and built a hardware-based medicine dispenser aimed at helping patients take medicines on time without missing doses.

Tools : Arduino UNO, Servo Motor, Ultrasonic Sensor, IR Sensor, RFID RC522, Buzzer
Description : Designed and built an automatic medicine dispenser with real-time patient monitoring using embedded hardware.

Key Features:
RFID Authentication – works only for authorized users
Automated Dispensing – servo motor rotates every 10 seconds (demo mode)
Stock Level Monitoring – ultrasonic sensor triggers buzzer when medicine is low
Missed Dose Alert – IR sensor detects if medicine is taken within 10 seconds, otherwise activates buzzer
Fully built using Arduino UNO and integrated sensors
This project can be beneficial for elderly patients, chronically ill individuals, and hospital use, reducing human error in medication schedules.
